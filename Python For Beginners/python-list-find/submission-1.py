""" List Find
We learned that we can determine if a list contains a specific element with the in operator. We can also find the index of an element in a list using the index() function.

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3]

print(my_list.index(3))  # Output: 2
The above code snippet will print the index of the first occurence of the element 3 in the list my_list. There are two 3s in the list, but the first one is at index 2, so 2 is printed. If the element is not present in the list, a ValueError will be raised.

Challenge
Implement the find_index(nums: List[int], target: int) -> int function. It should return the index of the first occurrence of the target number in the list. You may assume that the target number will always be present in the list.

If you want a challenge, try to implement the function without using the built-in index() method. """
