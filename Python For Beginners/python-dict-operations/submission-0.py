""" Dict Operations
Dictionaries can't contain duplicate keys, just like sets.

my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}

print(my_dict["a"]) # Output: 1

my_dict["a"] = 4

print(my_dict["a"]) # Output: 4
As shown above, if we assign the same key a new value, the old value is overwritten.

The values within a dictionary can be of any type, including lists, sets, and even other dictionaries.

my_dict = {"a": [1, 2, 3], "b": {4, 5, 6}, "c": {"x": 7, "y": 8, "z": 9}}

print(my_dict["a"]) # Output: [1, 2, 3]
print(my_dict["b"]) # Output: {4, 5, 6}
print(my_dict["c"]) # Output: {"x": 7, "y": 8, "z": 9}
The keys within a dictionary must be unique, but the values can be duplicated.

my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 1, "c": 1} # this is valid
To check if a dictionary contains a key, you can use the in keyword.

my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}

print("a" in my_dict) # Output: True
print("d" in my_dict) # Output: False
Challenge
In the code editor, there is a dictionary called your_dict. Perform the following operations in order:

Print the dictionary itself.
Print the value of the key "a".
Print True or False depending on whether the key "d" is in the dictionary.
Reassign the value of the key "a" to 4.
Print the dictionary again.

Are key-value pairs in a dict ordered?
In Python 3.7 and later, dictionaries are ordered by the order in which they were inserted. This means that the order of key-value pairs in a dictionary is preserved. """
