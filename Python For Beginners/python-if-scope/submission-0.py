""" If Statement Scope
Unlike functions, if statements do not create a new scope. This means that variables defined inside an if statement are accessible outside of the if statement. Here's an example:

if True:
    message = "Hello"

print(message)  # This will print "Hello"
They can also update variables that were defined outside of the if statement. Here's an example:

balance = -100

if balance < 0:
    balance = 0

print(balance)  # This will print 0
Within functions, if statements have the same scope as the function. This means that variables defined inside an if statement are accessible within that function, but not outside of it. Here's an example:

def is_balance_low(balance: int):
    if balance <= 100:
        message = "Warning: Low balance."
    print(message)

is_balance_low(50)  # This will print "Warning: Low balance."
print(message)  # This will cause an error
Challenge
In the code editor, implement the pay_bill(balance: int, bill: int) -> int function. It accepts two parameters, balance and bill, where balance is the current account balance and bill is the amount of the bill that needs to be paid.

If the balance is greater than or equal to the bill, the function should return the new balance after subtracting the bill from the balance. Otherwise, the function should return the balance without making any changes.
