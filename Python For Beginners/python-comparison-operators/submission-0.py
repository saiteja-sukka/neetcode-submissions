""" Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare values. They evaluate to True or False depending on the values you compare. For example, if we want to check if two values are equal, we use the == operator.

x, y = 3, 5
print(x == y)  # Output: False
We can't use a single = sign for comparison because it is reserved for assignment. The comparison operators are:

== Equal to
!= Not equal to
< Less than
> Greater than
<= Less than or equal to
>= Greater than or equal to
Challenge
Implement the six functions defined in the code editor.

check_equal(x, y) should return whether x is equal to y.
check_not_equal(x, y) should return whether x is not equal to y.
check_less_than(x, y) should return whether x is less than y.
check_greater_than(x, y) should return whether x is greater than y.
check_less_than_or_equal(x, y) should return whether x is less than or equal to y.
check_greater_than_or_equal(x, y) should return whether x is greater than or equal to y.
You may assume your functions will only receive integers as input. """
