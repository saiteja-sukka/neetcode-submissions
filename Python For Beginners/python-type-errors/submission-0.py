""" Type Errors
Even though variable types can change, there are still rules about what types of variables can be used together. For example, the following code will cause an error:

message = "Hello"
message = int(message)
We can't convert a string to an integer, unless the string is a number. This code will cause a ValueError.

Challenge
The code on the right will currently throw an error (you can run it to confirm). Can you find the bug and fix it so the output is:

10
<class 'str'>
10
<class 'int'> """
