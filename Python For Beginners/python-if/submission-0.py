""" If Statements
What if we wanted to run some code only in certain situations? We can use the keyword if to do this, aka an if statement. Here's an example:

account_balance = -100

if account_balance < 0:
    print("Your account is overdrawn.")

print("This is always printed.")
In this example, the code block under the if statement will only run if the account balance is less than 0. Notice how the code block is indented, just like with a function. This is how Python knows which code to run when the condition is true. Code that is not indented, is not a part of the if statement, and will always run, regardless of the condition.

If we had an if statement inside of a function, the code under the if statement would need to be indented twice, as shown below:

def is_account_overdraw(balance: int):
    if account_balance < 0:
        print("Your account is overdrawn.")
Challenge
In the code editor, implement the is_balance_low(balance: int) function. If the balance is less than or equal to 100, it should print "Warning: Low balance.". Otherwise, it should not print anything. """
