""" Strings are Immutable
It's important to know that whenever you slice a string, you are not modifying the underlying string. Instead, you are creating a new string with the sliced characters. This is because strings are immutable in Python, which means they cannot be changed after they are created.

message = "I will never change."

message[0] = "X" # This will cause an error
In the above code, we try to reassign just the first character of the string. This will cause a TypeError because strings are immutable. We cannot change individual characters, we can only reassign the entire string.

If we wanted to create a new string with the second character removed, we can accomplish this by slicing and concatenation.


message = "I will never change."

before_second = message[:1] # "I"
after_second = message[2:]  # "will never change."

new_message = before_second + after_second
Above, we removed the second character from the string (which was the space " "), and concatenated the two parts together to create a new string.

Challenge
Implement the function remove_fourth_character(word: str) -> str, which removes the fourth character from the string and returns the new string. You may assume that the length of the string is greater than 4. """
