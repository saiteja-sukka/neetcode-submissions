""" Intro to Sets
In Python, a set is very similar to a list, but with a few key differences.

A set is unordered, meaning the elements are not stored in a specific order. If order is important, you should use a list.
A set can only contain unique elements. If you try to add a duplicate element to a set, it will be ignored.
Here is an example:

my_set = {1, 2, 3}

print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3}

my_set = {3, 2, 1}

print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3}
As you can see, a set can be created using curly braces {} with elements separated by commas. When printing a set, the elements sometimes appear in sorted order, but this is not guaranteed. A set makes no gurantees about the order of the elements stored.

my_set = set()

my_set.add(1)
my_set.add(2)
my_set.add(1)

print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2}
Above we declared an empty set with set(). We then added the elements 1 and 2 to the set. When we tried to add 1 again, it was ignored because it was already in the set. This is because sets can not contain duplicate elements.


Why can't we declare an empty set with curly braces?
If we used empty curly braces {}, it would not have declared a set. That's because Python uses curly braces to declare an empty dictionary. A dictionary is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. We will learn more about dictionaries soon.

Challenge
Implement the function list_to_set(nums: List[int]) -> Set[int]. It should take a list of integers and return a set containing the unique elements from the list. The order the elements appear in the set does not matter. """
