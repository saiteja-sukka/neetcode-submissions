""" Length Function
Suppose we had a string like my_str = "NeetCode" and we wanted to know how many characters are in the string. We can use a built-in function called len() to find the length of a string (and many other data types as we will see).

my_str = "NeetCode"
print(len(my_str))  # Output: 8
The function len() returns the number of characters in the string. In this case, the string "NeetCode" has 8 characters.

Challenge
Implement a function called get_longer_word(word1: str, word2: str) -> str. It takes two words (strings) as parameters, and returns the longer word. If the words are the same length, return the first word. """
