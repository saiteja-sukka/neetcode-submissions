""" Intro to Lists
In Python a list is a collection of items that are stored in a specific order.

my_list = [1, 2, 3]

print(len(my_list))  # Output: 3

print(my_list[0])  # Output: 1
print(my_list[1])  # Output: 2
print(my_list[2])  # Output: 3
As you can see, we can access individual elements in the list by indexing it just like with a string. We can also get the number of elements within the list by calling the len() function.

But there is a key difference between lists and strings. Lists are mutable, meaning we can change the values of the elements in the list.

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

my_list[0] = 10

print(my_list[0])  # Output: 10
Lists can also store more than just numbers, they can store everything from strings to other lists.

my_list = ["I", "am", "a", "list"]

print(my_list[0])  # Output: I
print(my_list[1])  # Output: am
print(my_list[2])  # Output: a
print(my_list[3])  # Output: list
We can even mix and match different types of elements in a list. This is generally not recommended, but it is possible.

my_list = [1, "Hello", 3.14, True]
Challenge
In the code editor, there is a list called my_list. Print the following in the order given (each on a separate line):

The second element in the list.
The third element in the list.
The first element in the list.
The length of the list.
