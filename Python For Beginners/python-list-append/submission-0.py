""" List Append
We can do more than just change individual elements within a list. We can also add new elements to the end of a list using the append() function.

my_list = [1, 2, 3]

print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]

my_list.append(4)

print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
A few things to notice:

We can print an entire list at once.
The append() function adds an element to the end of the list. This is not a separate function, it's called with a period after the list name (.append()). This is called a method. It is a function that is associated with a specific object (in this case, a list is an object).
After calling append, the original list has been modified to include the new element at the end. The length increased from 3 to 4.
Challenge
Implement a function called append_to_list(my_list: List[int], elements: List[int]) -> List[int]. It should append each number from elements to the end of my_list and return the modified list. """
