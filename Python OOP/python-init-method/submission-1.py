""" Init Method
The __init__ method we've been using is a special method in Python classes, also known as a constructor. Its job is to initialize the attributes of a new object when it's created.

The __init__ method is technically not a constructor in Python, but it's often referred to as one. The __new__ method is the actual constructor in Python.

class SuperHero:
    def __init__(self, name, power):
        self.name = name
        self.power = power
The __init__ method is automatically called when we create a new object from our class. It sets up the initial state of the object.

In the above code, __init__ is responsible for setting the initial values for name and power for each new superhero we create.

# Creating a superhero
iron_man = SuperHero("Iron Man", "repulsor beams")
Above we created a SuperHero object called iron_man which calls the __init__ method. Logically, this is equivalent to SuperHero.__init__(iron_man, "Iron Man", "repulsor beams")

We don't need to explicitly pass anything for the self parameter because Python handles this automatically.
self inside __init__ refers to the new iron_man object
The other parameters are passed to the __init__ method to initialize the attributes of the object
After this process, iron_man is a fully initialized SuperHero object with all its attributes set.

Challenge
We have a Pet class, but its __init__ method is missing. Currently, the code will produce the following error when you try to run it.

TypeError: Pet() takes no arguments
Your task is add the __init__ method to the Pet class to initialize the name, species, and age attributes when a new pet is created.

Expected Output
Fluffy is a 3 year old cat.
Buddy is a 2 year old dog.

Hints
- The __init__ method is called automatically when creating a new object. - Think about the parameters the __init__ method should have.

Key Points About self and __init__
The init method is automatically called when creating a new object.
self is always the first parameter in method definitions, including init.
When creating objects or calling methods, we don't explicitly provide self - Python handles this automatically.
Inside init, self refers to the newly created object.
Use init to set initial values for the object's attributes.

Attributes outside of __init__
Attributes outside of init and other methods are class attributes, shared by all instances of the class. """
