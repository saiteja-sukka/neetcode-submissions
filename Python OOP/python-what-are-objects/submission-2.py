class Pet:
    def __init__(self, name: str, species: str, hunger: int, energy: int):
        self.name = name
        self.species = species
        self.hunger = hunger
        self.energy = energy

# Don't modify the above code

# TODO: Create a pet named "Whiskers" that is a species of 'cat' with hunger level 6 and energy level 8

""" What are Objects?
An object is an instance of a class. It's a specific item created using the blueprint defined by the class.

Creating Objects
We have seen the class definition for a SuperHero before.

class SuperHero:
    def __init__(self, name: str, power: str, health: int, speed: int):
        self.name = name
        self.power = power
        self.health = health
        self.speed = speed
We can create an object by calling the class and passing in the required arguments.

# Creating superhero objects
iron_man = SuperHero("Iron Man", "repulsor beams", 100, 80)
spider_man = SuperHero("Spider Man", "web slinging", 90, 95)
When we write iron_man = SuperHero("Iron Man", "repulsor beams", 100, 80), we're telling Python:

Create a new object variable called iron_man
Use the SuperHero class to create it
Set its name attribute to "Iron Man"
Set its power attribute to "repulsor beams"
Set its health attribute to 100
Set its speed attribute to 80
Challenge
You have given the code for a Pet class. When run, this code produces an error:

NameError: name 'whiskers' is not defined
To fix this error and get the expected output, complete the following task:

Create a pet with a name of Whiskers, which is a cat with hunger level 6 and energy level 8.
Note: The name of the variable should be whiskers (no uppercase).

Expected Output:

Whiskers (cat) - Hunger: 6, Energy: 8

Hint
Object creation: pet_name = Pet("Name", "species", hunger_value, energy_value)

The importance of parameter order
When creating a new superhero object, the order of values must match the __init__ method:

def __init__(self, name, power, health, speed)
Example:

Correct order
correct_hero = SuperHero("Captain America", "super strength", 110, 85)
Incorrect order
incorrect_hero = SuperHero(100, "Hulk", 75, "gamma radiation")
In the incorrect example, the order of attributes is mismatched. Be careful, Python won't give us any errors for this incorrect order, which means we need to be careful when creating our objects! """
